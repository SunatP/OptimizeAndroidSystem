# Problem on Android


## This is a big problem after root and tweak kernel 


## After Flashed ViPER4ANDROID Found Scratching sound ,noise sound 
						Solve : Go Setting on ViPER -> Three dots -> FX Compatible Mode -> Compatible (Not Prove Yet)


### Freeze After Tweak By using
					    Too Low Voltage is Risk to your Phone 
						Recommend Increase *+25mV*
						Use Governors Wrong that's mean Lag , Stuck , Freeze , Slower than normally (Read The Topic CPU Governors From XDA) 
						Increase Clock of CPU Higher Than Normally (Set CPU at Screen off Over than normally)

### Magisk System , SuperSU missing or disappoint after restart sometime
						*Magisk*
						After Restart-> Go to Magisk and Module is not install try to *Restart* Your Phone 
						If your Magisk module is already hide try to Flash The Lastest Version (v15.3) and via Recovery Mode And Install Magisk Manager Lastest version at the moment (v5.5.5)
						*SuperSU*
						I have try to root by SuperSU But never found this problem because SuperSU replace with SuperSU in boot.img that's mean when you power on your phone SuperSU will *Autostart* with Android System
						After flash new firmware stock boot image will replace will paste SuperSU boot.img
